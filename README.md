# Problems-Repository
Problems repository for my solved dsa questions

## Things Required
* MySql - you can install mysql based on machine you are using
the DDL script is already defined in project. (I was lazy to create strong/sensible db name and schema feel free to update according to your use)
* Golang - Golang is used as backend for the project. No additional framework is used for http interfaces

## How to build
* If you are on mac/linux you can run the build.sh which would add prepo (Problems Repository) command to your terminal
* If you are on Windows you need to build the app manually. You can add the executable to PATH after you build (I would suggest to use WSL if you are on windows)
